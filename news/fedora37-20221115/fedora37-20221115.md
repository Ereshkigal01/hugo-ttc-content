Fedora one of the most popular distributions based on RHEL is facing another delay for it's latest release version 37. Usually the fedora development team marks an early release (beta) date and a release date for their flagship operating-system.

However if we look at the version 37 release dates it has been already delayed in the past from 18th October to 25th October then to 1st November. Now its getting delayed for another 15 days. 

**YES 15 MORE DAYS !!**  

As per the latest schedule we are expecting a release on 15th November for Fedora 37.

## But why all the delay ??
As per the information provided in the [Fedora-blog](https://fedoramagazine.org/fedora-linux-37-update/) this is due to OpenSSL version. The OpenSSL team announced that they are patching a major security bug for their software on November the first and until the release the Fedora team was unaware of the same. 
RedHat the company behind Fedora and CentOS recommends waiting for the patch before releasing the new version of Fedora, so maybe looking at these Fedora team has decided to postpone the release dates a bit.

***As stated in the Fedora-Blog***
> Most decisions happen with imperfect information. This one is particularly imperfect. If you’re not familiar with the embargo process, you might not understand why. When a security issue is discovered, this information is often shared with the project confidentially. This allows the developers to fix the issue before more people know about it and can exploit it. Projects then share information with downstreams so they can be ready.

> Ironically, Fedora’s openness means we can’t start preparing ahead of time. All of our build pipelines and artifacts are open. If we were to start building updates, this would disclose the vulnerability before the embargo lifts. As a result, we only know that OpenSSL considers this the highest level of severity and Red Hat’s Product Security team strongly recommended we wait for a fix before releasing Fedora Linux 37.


So it is clear the the Fedora team is not going to compromise on security and testing just to meet a schedule, so users of 37 can get the same level of quality they’ve come to expect.

## But how long ?

While talking about the testing of the new release candidate of the OS with new OpesnSSL version they said that they need adequate time to test the release candidate with the updated packages. While rushing may seem a good idea but as per the development team they will only release the OS when they are confident of it. 

> We make the “go/no-go” decision on Thursdays for a release the following Tuesday. This gives time for the images to update to the mirrors. The OpenSSL project team plans to publish the security fix about 48 hours before we’d make the go/no-go decision for an 8 November target. Factoring in time to build the updated openssl package and generate a release candidate, that gives us about a day and a half to do testing. That’s not enough time to be comfortable with a change to such an important package.

> As a result, we’re giving ourselves an extra week so that we can be confident that Fedora Linux 37 has the same level of quality you’ve come to expect.

In my opinion if this is a really major security patch, it is maybe a good idea to hold the release and test the OS before pushing it to the world. However, the delay could be for nothing if the fix is not a massive one.
